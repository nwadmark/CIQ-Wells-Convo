## Key Design Features

### Vibrant Color Palette
Stripe's signature colors including purple (#5E46BF), blue (#1CA8FF), and gradient colors for dynamic backgrounds.

### Animated Gradients
Beautiful, performant gradient animations that create Stripe's characteristic "wave" effect on hero sections and backgrounds.

### Modern Components
All components follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines while maintaining Stripe's distinctive style.

### Accessibility First
Every component is designed with accessibility in mind - proper contrast ratios, touch targets, and VoiceOver support.

## How to Use This Skill

### In Claude Code

When working on iOS projects, Claude will automatically use this skill when you request Stripe-style design:

```
"Create a login screen with Stripe's design style"
"Build a dashboard with gradient header like Stripe"
"Add a payment form using Stripe's component library"
```

You can also explicitly invoke the skill:

```
@ios-stripe-style Create an onboarding flow
```

### Getting Started

1. **Quick Start**: Check `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for color codes, spacing, and component specs

2. **Full Guide**: Read `SKILL.md` for complete documentation, code examples, and best practices

3. **Templates**: Copy code from `templates/` directory for complete screen examples

## Example Usage

### Creating a Login Screen

Ask Claude:
```
Using the Stripe style, create a login view with email/password fields,
animated gradient background, and a branded button
```

Claude will generate a complete SwiftUI view using the Stripe design system.

### Building a Dashboard

Ask Claude:
```
Create a dashboard with metric cards showing revenue, customers,
and transactions using Stripe's card grid pattern
```

Claude will build a comprehensive dashboard with Stripe's visual style.

### Custom Components

Ask Claude:
```
Create a custom profile card component that matches Stripe's design aesthetic
```

Claude will design a component using the color palette, spacing, and patterns defined in this skill.

## Design Principles

This skill embodies Stripe's core design principles:

1. **Elegant Simplicity** - Clean, uncluttered interfaces
2. **Vibrant Colors** - Purposeful use of gradients and brand colors
3. **Clear Hierarchy** - Typography and spacing that guides users
4. **Purposeful Motion** - Smooth, meaningful animations
5. **Accessible Design** - Works for everyone, everywhere

## What Makes This Different

Unlike generic iOS design systems, this skill captures Stripe's specific aesthetic:

- ✨ Animated gradient backgrounds (not just static colors)
- 🎨 Vibrant purple-blue color scheme
- 💳 Payment/financial interface patterns
- 📊 Metric and dashboard layouts
- 🎯 Stripe's specific spacing and typography choices

## Quick Reference

### Colors
```
Purple: #5E46BF  |  Blue: #1CA8FF
Pink: #ef008f    |  Light Blue: #6ec3f4
```

### Spacing
```
Small: 8pt  |  Medium: 16pt  |  Large: 24pt
```

### Components
- StripeButton - Branded button with loading states
- StripeCard - Elevated card container
- StripeTextField - Styled input field
- StripeAnimatedGradient - Animated background
- StripeBadge - Status/label badge
- StripeSectionHeader - Section titles

## Files You'll Get

When Claude uses this skill, it will reference:

1. **Color definitions** - Complete SwiftUI color structs
2. **Typography scale** - Font specifications
3. **Component code** - Copy-paste ready SwiftUI views
4. **Layout patterns** - Common screen compositions
5. **Accessibility helpers** - VoiceOver and Dynamic Type support

## Best For

This skill is perfect for:

- 💰 Payment and financial apps
- 📊 Dashboard and analytics interfaces
- 🔐 Authentication flows
- 📱 Modern SaaS mobile apps
- 🎨 Any app wanting Stripe's polished aesthetic

## Examples in Templates

Check out the templates directory for complete, working examples:

- **LoginView.swift** - Full authentication screen with gradient background
- **DashboardView.swift** - Metrics dashboard with card grid and charts

Both files are production-ready and can be copied directly into your Xcode project.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: "Create a Stripe-style login form" works better than "make a login screen"
2. **Reference components**: Ask for specific components like "StripeButton" or "StripeCard"
3. **Mention patterns**: Request "gradient header" or "card grid" for specific layouts
4. **Copy examples**: Use the template files as starting points
